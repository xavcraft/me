### Credits
- gooHue originally made in vanilla JS with GSAP by Chris Gannon, I've ported it to React and `styled-components` to understand how to animate SVGs. You should check his work on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/chrisgannon/).
- Layout inspired by MadeByElvis, madebyelvis.com. You should check his work on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/madebyelvis).
